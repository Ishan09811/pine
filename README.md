### Contact
You can contact the core developers of Pine at our **[Discord]()**. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It's also a good place to just keep up with the emulator, as most talk regarding development goes on over there.

### Special Thanks

**[Strato](https://github.com/strato-emu/strato)**
Thanks for their many improvements.

A few noteworthy teams/projects who've helped us along the way are:
* **[Skyline](https://skyline-emu.one/):** Pine is an experimental project built on top of Skyline. While Skyline continues as Strato, Pine is designed for testing experimental features and for personal learning.

* **[Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org/):** We've used Ryujinx for reference throughout the project, the accuracy of their HLE implementations of Switch subsystems make it an amazing reference. The team behind the project has been extremely helpful with any queries we've had and have constantly helped us with any issues we've come across. **It should be noted that Pine is not based on Ryujinx**.

* **[strato](https://github.com/strato-emu/strato):** Pine's shader compiler is a **fork** of *strato*'s shader compiler with pine-specific changes.

* **[Switchbrew](https://github.com/switchbrew/):** We've extensively used Switchbrew whether that be their **[wiki](https://switchbrew.org/)** with its colossal amount of information on the Switch that has saved us countless hours of time or **[libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx)** which was crucial to initial development of the emulator to ensure that our HLE kernel and sysmodule implementations were accurate.
